# Recovering the CTR_DRBG state in 256 traces

This is the code that exemplifies the attack described in "Recovering the CTR_DRBG state in 256 traces".

For information about JuPyter Notebooks: see https://jupyter.org

The code allows to choose between different devices for the traces.
- CORTEX : traces from a Cortex M4, using the ChipWhisperer Lite board with STM32F3 target mounted on UFO board
- DUINO : traces from Arduino Uno device (The traces are too large to upload on Github, but can be sent to you by request)
- XMEGA : traces from the built-in XMEGA on the ChipWhisperer Lite board
